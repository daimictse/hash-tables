1. A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs with unique key values.

2. Hashing is a conversion from a arbitrary data to a numerical index using a hashing function.

3. Hash table take the key-value pair, hashing the key, find the internal array index by "mod"ing the hash code, and store the value in the array index.

4. Hash tables are intended to be used as collections of similar data. Objects hold different types of data bundled together.
